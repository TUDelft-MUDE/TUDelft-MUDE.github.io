All the "old stuff" can be found here, of which part of it requires a TUDelft login.

The MUDE Textbook is published with an open CC BY license beginning with the 2024-25 academic year. This means you can access it without a password!

Beginning with the 2024 academic year, as a general rule, the following will occur:

- The book will remain openly accessible and instructions for citing it or (re)using contents are provided on the Credits page; the current year can be accessed at [mude.citg.tudelft.nl/book](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/book/)
- As chapters will be released on a weekly basis during the academic year, the book from the previous year is the most recent complete version (e.g., for Fall 2025, use the 2024 book, available at [mude.citg.tudelft.nl/book/2024](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/book/2024))
- sometime after Q2 ends in January, the book and assignments from that academic year will be shared via the Archive pages on this website
- student work that is carried out via GitHub will remain private; it will be accessible to students as long as your GitHub account remains active

Unfortunately it is not possible to share materials publicly from the first two years of MUDE (2022-23 and 2023-24), although much of them are availble via TU Delft login on this website. Inquiries about materials from these years can be sent to MUDE-CEG@tudelft.nl.
