# Old exams

Exams and resits from previous years available here. The exams are provided in two formats:

- Blank exam (PDF): this file shows the exam format that the student can expect in the exam (i.e., if printed on A4 paper, this is exactly where the answers would be written).
- Exam Solution (HTML): the HTML files illustrate the exam questions and answers.

Some general remarks:
- The style of questions in the old exams is representative of the style of questions you will see this year.
- The scope of the exam is governed by the contents of the online textbook, and exceptions are stated in the book. If you see a discrepancy between the textbook and the sample exams, the textbook governs.
- A portion of the questions this year will take inspiration from the assignments we have done on Wednesday and Friday (but not all of the questions) and the programming assignments; it would be wise to review this when preparing for the exam.
- In addition, programming topics changed over the years: questions from previous years illustrate how programming will be asked, but not necessarily the content. As the scope of Programming Assignments changes from year to year, you may see topics that are unfamiliar to you.

## 2022-2023 exams

Note that for the 2022-2023 academic year the format of the module and specific topics were significantly different. Leading to changes in the exams too:

- There were around 8 or 9 “Questions” on the exam, each with multiple sub-questions. This year there will be fewer “Questions,” which of course means the value (in points) will be more for each of them.
- Some questions or portions of questions may make reference to topics that have not been covered in the current academic year. For example, ‘W-test’ in sensing and observation theory was not covered, so you may exclude this topic for your studies.
- Previous time series questions looked at ARMA: this is not part of this year's exam (specifically MA = moving average; AR = autoregressive is part of the exam!). In addition, the Partial ACF (PACF) may appear on previous exams in 2022-2023, but is not required this year.
- Finite element material was covered extensively in 2022-2023, it is now reduced.
- Extreme value analysis was covered in a reduced form and was in Q2, it is now expanded and part of Q1
