# 2022-2023

All course materials for this year are collected on a single website: mude.citg.tudelft.nl/archive-2022.

During the 2022-223 academic year (the first year of MUDE!) course materials were shared via Brightspace and GitLab was used for student assignment submissions and feedback. To make materials readable and serve as a quick reference for MUDE staff and students, all course materials were collected in a single website (built using Jupyter Book), which contains an overview page for each week at the beginning of each chapter, and all materials rendered in a webpage format (e.g., Jupyter notebooks are turned into web pages). It is not meant to be read as an online textbook. The book/website can be accessed with a TU Delft NetID.

For external access, contact MUDE Staff. For technical content, although it may be possible to give access to students who participated in the 2022-2023 academic year, we recommend using more recent course materials, as many improvements have been made since.
