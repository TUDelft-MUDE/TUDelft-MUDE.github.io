# 2023-2024

This was the first year MUDE had its own set of websites to provide materials to students, most of which was only accessible behind a TU Delft login (NetID). GitLab was also used to provide source code to students(e.g., Jupyter notebooks) and grade assignments.

In order to prepare for the 2024-2025 Academic Year, the websites from 2023-2024 had to be moved to a new URL, which contains 2023/. This allows materials from different years to exist online at the same time (see ðŸ’¡ Tip below if you are having trouble finding material from 2023-2024).

You can easily find the archived page by adding 2023/ to the URL. For example:

`...nl/book/fvm/getting_started.html` â†’ `...nl/2023/book/fvm/getting_started.html.`

This also works with non-book pages as well.
